# About This Site

This portfolio documents my work in **ECE 4160: Fast Robots** at Cornell University (Spring 2026).

## Course Overview

Fast Robots is a hands-on course focused on building autonomous robots capable of high-speed navigation and control. Throughout the semester, we develop:

- **Sensor integration** — Working with IMUs, ToF sensors, and encoders
- **Real-time control systems** — Implementing PID controllers and Kalman filters
- **Embedded programming** — Writing efficient C++ on the Artemis platform
- **Python data analysis** — Processing and visualizing sensor data
- **Autonomous navigation** — Localization, mapping, and path planning

## About Me

I'm a student at Cornell exploring the intersection of robotics, embedded systems, and controls.
